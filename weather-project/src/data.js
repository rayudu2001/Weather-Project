        "question": "What are the causes of air pollution?",
        "answer": [
          "Burning fossil fuels in vehicles like cars, trucks, and buses, which emit harmful gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",
          "Industrial emissions from factories and power plants, which release pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",
          "Deforestation and land-use changes, which can increase the amount of dust and particulate matter in the air.",
          "Agricultural practices, such as the use of fertilizers and pesticides, which can release ammonia (NH3) and other chemicals that contribute to air pollution.",
          "Waste disposal and burning of waste, including plastic, which release toxic substances like dioxins and furans into the air."

        "question": "What are the solutions to air pollution?",
        "answer": [
          "Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.",
          "Promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce emissions from transportation.",
          "Implementing stricter emissions regulations for industries and vehicles.",
          "Adopting cleaner agricultural practices, such as using organic fertilizers and reducing pesticide use.",
          "Encouraging the use of public transport, biking, and walking to reduce individual car usage.",
          "Planting trees and creating green spaces in urban areas to absorb pollutants and improve air quality."

        "question": "What are the global statistics on air pollution?",
        "answer": [
          "Air pollution is responsible for approximately 7 million premature deaths each year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).",
          "Over 90% of the global population breathes air that exceeds the World Health Organization's air quality limits, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.",
          "Countries with the most polluted air include India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and other South Asian nations, where particulate matter levels often exceed safe limits.",
          "Air pollution causes about 4.2 million deaths annually due to respiratory diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer.",
          "It is also a leading cause of heart disease, with exposure to particulate matter increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes.",
          "Air pollution contributes significantly to ecosystem damage, reducing biodiversity and harming forests, crops, and water bodies. Acid rain caused by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides is a major environmental threat.",
          "Air pollution accelerates climate change by contributing to the release of short-lived climate pollutants like black carbon (soot) and methane, which trap heat in the atmosphere."
